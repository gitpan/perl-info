Notes on the conversion of the perl 5.002 pod documentation to GNU Info format.
Converted by Nick Gianniotis <nico@acm.org>, Mon Jun 10 1996.

1. Please read the notes in README, which explain the original process by which
   Krishna Sethuraman (krishna@mit.edu) converted the perl 5.000 pods into
   Info format.

2. I followed pretty much exactly the same steps, converting pod ->
   texinfo via pod2texinfo.pl, and texinfo -> info via
   `texinfo-format-buffer' in emacs.

3. As the original notes explain, extensive manual "cleaning up" of the
   texinfo files was required again. I did not alter or improve the perl
   program pod2texinfo.pl, as many problems were of a irregular nature and
   some due to incorrect mark-ups in the pod files. This step will always
   remain manual as information not present in the pods must be added.

4. Only the core perl pods which come bundled with perl 5.002 were
   converted. The modpods remain as a project for the next hapless
   volunteer with a spare afternoon!
